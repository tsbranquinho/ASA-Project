# Project 1: Optimizing Marble Cutting (Análise e Síntese de Algoritmos - Project 1)

## Project Description

This project was developed as part of the **Análise e Síntese de Algoritmos** course during the 2023/2024 academic year. The goal was to design a solution for optimizing the cutting process of marble slabs, aiming to produce the maximum possible value from a given slab by making vertical and horizontal cuts based on customer requirements.
