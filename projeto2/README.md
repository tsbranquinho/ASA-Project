# Project 2: Disease Transmission Simulation (Análise e Síntese de Algoritmos - Project 2)

## Project Description

In this project, the task was to simulate the transmission of diseases in a population using a directed graph representing social relationships. The objective was to compute the maximum number of transmission steps a disease can take through the network, where individuals are infected through direct or indirect connections.
