# Project 3: Christmas Toy Production Optimization (Análise e Síntese de Algoritmos - Project 3)

## Project Description

For this project, the goal was to optimize toy production and sales during the Christmas season. The company needed to determine the maximum profit obtainable by producing a set of toys and special packages, considering production limits and the cost-benefit of producing packages containing different types of toys.

The solution was implemented using Python and PuLP for solving the Linear Programming (LP) problem.
